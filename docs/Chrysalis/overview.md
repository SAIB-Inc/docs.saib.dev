### How Chrysalis Started
 Recognizing that C# and .NET are among the most popular and widely-used development languages and frameworks globally, it was evident there was a significant gap—there simply wasn't adequate tooling available for .NET developers to build robust, production-grade applications on Cardano.

Driven by the vision to bridge this gap, SAIB Inc posed a critical question:

> "Why should .NET developers be forced to leave their familiar tools and workflows to leverage blockchain technology?"

Chrysalis was thus born, combining the immense potential of Cardano with the extensive capabilities of the .NET ecosystem, making blockchain development accessible and efficient for millions of developers worldwide.
