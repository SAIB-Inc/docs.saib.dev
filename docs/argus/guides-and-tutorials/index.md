# üöÄ Guides

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and using Argus, from installation to running your first blockchain indexer application.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:
```
- .NET 8.0 SDK or later installed
- PostgreSQL database installed and running
- Access to a Cardano node (local or remote)
```

## üîç Step-by-Step Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Packages

First, create a new .NET project and add the necessary packages:

```bash
# Create a new web application
dotnet new web -n ArgusExample

# Navigate to the project directory
cd ArgusExample

# Install the main package
dotnet add package Argus.Sync --version 0.3.1-alpha

# Required dependencies
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
dotnet add package Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Define Your Data Models

Create models that represent the blockchain data you want to store:

```csharp
using Argus.Sync.Data.Models;

// Define your model
public record BlockInfo(
    string Hash,       // Block hash
    ulong Number,      // Block number
    ulong Slot,        // Block slot number
    DateTime CreatedAt // Timestamp
) : IReducerModel;
```

#### What is IReducerModel?

> 
> The `IReducerModel` interface is a marker interface in Argus that identifies classes that can be processed by reducers. By implementing this interface:
>
> - **Automatic Discovery**: Your model becomes eligible for automatic discovery by Argus's dependency injection system
> - **Reducer Processing**: It can be processed by reducers that implement `IReducer<T>` where T is your model
> - **Chain Consistency**: It enables Argus to maintain consistency during chain rollbacks

#### Chain Rollback Handling

> One of the most critical aspects of blockchain indexing is handling chain rollbacks, which occur when the blockchain temporarily forks and then resolves to a single chain. During a rollback:
>
> 1. Some previously confirmed blocks become invalidated
> 2. New blocks from the winning chain need to be processed
> 3. Any data derived from invalidated blocks must be rolled back

By implementing `IReducerModel`, your data model becomes part of Argus's systematic approach to handling these rollbacks:

- The framework tracks which models need to be updated during rollbacks
- It correctly orders operations to maintain referential integrity
- It ensures your database state accurately reflects the current blockchain state
- It connects your models to their appropriate reducers for both forward and backward operations

:::important
This is why the `BlockReducer` implements both `RollForwardAsync` and `RollBackwardAsync` methods - to properly handle chain rollbacks while maintaining data consistency.

While `IReducerModel` doesn't define any methods or properties (it's a marker interface), it's essential for the Argus framework to identify which models should be integrated into the blockchain data processing pipeline.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Database Context

Create a database context to manage your models:

```csharp
using Argus.Sync.Data;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

public class MyDbContext(
    DbContextOptions options,
    IConfiguration configuration
) : CardanoDbContext(options, configuration)
{
    public DbSet<BlockInfo> Blocks => Set<BlockInfo>();

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);

        modelBuilder.Entity<BlockInfo>(entity =>
        {
            entity.HasKey(e => e.Hash);
            entity.Property(e => e.CreatedAt).HasDefaultValueSql("now()");
        });
    }
}
```

#### What is CardanoDbContext?

>
> The `CardanoDbContext` is a specialized Entity Framework Core `DbContext` provided by Argus that serves as the foundation for Cardano blockchain data indexing. When you inherit from it, your database context gains several important capabilities:
>
> - **Chain Tracking**: Built-in infrastructure to track blockchain state and synchronization progress
> - **Transaction Management**: Specialized handling for blockchain-specific operations and rollbacks
> - **Schema Management**: Automatic setup and maintenance of system tables required by Argus
> - **Configuration Integration**: Seamless connection with Argus configuration settings

#### Implementation Requirements

In your custom DbContext implementation:

- Define `DbSet<T>` properties for each model you want to store and query
- Override `OnModelCreating` to configure your entity relationships and constraints
- Always call the base class implementation with `base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder)` to ensure proper setup

:::note
Argus manages transaction boundaries during blockchain synchronization, helping maintain data consistency even during chain rollbacks.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Reducers

Create reducers that process blockchain data:

```csharp
using Argus.Sync.Reducers;
using Chrysalis.Cbor.Types.Cardano.Core;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

public class BlockReducer(IDbContextFactory<MyDbContext> dbContextFactory)
    : IReducer<BlockInfo>
{
    public async Task RollForwardAsync(Block block)
    {
        // Extract block data
        string hash = block.Header().Hash();
        ulong number = block.Header().HeaderBody().BlockNumber();
        ulong slot = block.Header().HeaderBody().Slot();

        // Store in database
        using var db = dbContextFactory.CreateDbContext();
        db.Blocks.Add(new BlockInfo(hash, number, slot, DateTime.UtcNow));
        await db.SaveChangesAsync();
    }

    public async Task RollBackwardAsync(ulong slot)
    {
        // Remove any blocks at or after the rollback slot
        using var db = dbContextFactory.CreateDbContext();
        db.Blocks.RemoveRange(
            db.Blocks.Where(b => b.Slot >= slot)
        );
        await db.SaveChangesAsync();
    }
}
```

#### What is IReducer?

>
> The `IReducer<T>` interface is at the core of Argus's data processing pipeline. It defines how blockchain data is transformed and stored in your database:
>
> - **Purpose**: Converts raw blockchain data into application-specific models
> - **Type Parameter**: The `T` in `IReducer<T>` is your model type that implements `IReducerModel`
> - **Integration**: Automatically discovered and registered when you call `AddReducers<TContext, TModel>()` in your service configuration

#### Required Methods

`IReducer<T>` requires implementing two key methods:

| Method | Purpose | Parameters | Responsibility |
|--------|---------|------------|----------------|
| **RollForwardAsync** | Process new blocks | `Block` object | Extract data, transform, and persist |
| **RollBackwardAsync** | Handle chain rollbacks | `ulong slot` | Remove data from invalidated blocks |

#### RollForwardAsync
- Called when processing new blocks from the blockchain
- Receives a `Block` object containing all block data
- Responsible for extracting relevant information
- Transforms raw blockchain data into your domain model
- Persists the data to your database

#### RollBackwardAsync
- Called during chain rollbacks when previously processed blocks become invalid
- Receives a slot number indicating the point to roll back to
- Must remove or update any data derived from blocks at or after the given slot
- Ensures database consistency with the canonical blockchain

#### Example Explained

In the example above:

> **Roll Forward Process**
>
> - Extracts the block hash, number, and slot from the block header 
> - Creates a new `BlockInfo` record with the extracted data
> - Adds it to the database context and saves the changes

> **Roll Backward Process**
>
> - Finds all block records with a slot number greater than or equal to the rollback point
> - Removes these records from the database
> - This ensures that any blocks that are no longer part of the canonical chain are removed

:::important
The combination of these two methods ensures that your database always reflects the current state of the blockchain, even when the chain undergoes rollbacks.
:::

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Application Settings

Argus requires specific configuration settings to connect to a Cardano node and manage synchronization. Create an `appsettings.json` file with the following key sections:

- **ConnectionStrings**: Database connection information
- **CardanoNodeConnection**: Settings for connecting to the Cardano node
- **Sync**: Configuration for the synchronization process

For detailed explanation of all configuration options, see the [Configuration Guide](/docs/argus/getting-started/configuration.md).

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "CardanoContext": "Host=localhost;Database=argus;Username=postgres;Password=password;Port=5432",
    "CardanoContextSchema": "cardanoindexer"
  },
  "CardanoNodeConnection": {
    "ConnectionType": "UnixSocket",
    "UnixSocket": {
      "Path": "/path/to/node.socket"
    },
    "NetworkMagic": 764824073,
    "MaxRollbackSlots": 1000,
    "RollbackBuffer": 10,
    "Slot": 139522569,
    "Hash": "3fd9925888302fca267c580d8fe6ebc923380d0b984523a1dfbefe88ef089b66"
  },
  "Sync": {
    "Dashboard": {
      "TuiMode": true,
      "RefreshInterval": 5000,
      "DisplayType": "sync"
    }
  }
}
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Register Services

Register Argus services in your `Program.cs`:

```csharp
using Argus.Sync.Extensions;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Register Argus services
builder.Services.AddCardanoIndexer<MyDbContext>(builder.Configuration);
builder.Services.AddReducers<MyDbContext, IReducerModel>(builder.Configuration);

var app = builder.Build();
app.Run();
```

#### What are the Extension Methods?

>
> The two extension methods used above are crucial for setting up the Argus indexing framework and making everything work together automatically.

#### Extension Method Overview

| Method | Purpose | Type Parameters |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **AddCardanoIndexer** | Configure core infrastructure | `<TContext>` - Your database context |
| **AddReducers** | Set up data transformation pipeline | `<TContext, TModel>` - Your context and model marker interface |

#### AddCardanoIndexer

> This method configures the core infrastructure required for Cardano blockchain synchronization:
>
> - Registers and configures the database connection using your custom DbContext
> - Sets up the connection to the Cardano node based on your appsettings.json configuration
> - Initializes the blockchain tip tracking system to maintain synchronization state
> - Registers background services that handle the continuous synchronization process
> - Configures internal metrics and monitoring capabilities
> - Establishes transaction handling mechanisms specific to blockchain operations

#### AddReducers

> This method sets up the data transformation pipeline:
>
> - Scans your application for all classes that implement IReducer where T implements IReducerModel
> - Automatically registers these reducers with the dependency injection system
> - Maps reducers to their respective models for processing
> - Configures the processing order to ensure data consistency during synchronization
> - Connects reducers to the chain synchronization pipeline

#### Key Benefit

These extension methods work together to create a fully functional Cardano blockchain indexer with minimal code, handling all the complex wiring between your custom logic and the Argus framework.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Create and Apply Migrations

Generate and apply Entity Framework migrations:

```bash
# Create the initial migration
dotnet ef migrations add InitialMigration

# Apply the migration to the database
dotnet ef database update
```

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Run Your Application

Start your application to begin synchronizing with the blockchain:

```bash
dotnet run
```

## üß† Understanding the Process

After following this guide, you've created an Argus indexer application that implements all the key components of blockchain data processing:

1. **Data Models** - Your `IReducerModel` classes define what blockchain data you want to extract and store

2. **Database Context** - Your custom `CardanoDbContext` provides the data persistence layer with proper entity configuration

3. **Reducers** - Your `IReducer<T>` implementations contain the business logic for transforming blockchain data

4. **Infrastructure** - The Argus extension methods handle the complex synchronization process

When your application runs, this pipeline activates:

- **Initialization**: The application connects to your Cardano node using the configuration provided
- **Synchronization**: Argus starts fetching blocks from the blockchain in sequence
- **Processing**: Each block passes through your reducers via the `RollForwardAsync` method
- **Persistence**: Your extracted and transformed data is stored in the database
- **Consistency**: If chain rollbacks occur, Argus automatically invokes `RollBackwardAsync` to maintain data integrity
- **Monitoring**: The synchronization dashboard shows real-time processing status

## üë£ Next Steps

Now that you understand the core concepts of Argus and have a working indexer, you can expand your application:

### Enhance Your Indexer

- **Additional Reducers**: Create reducers for transactions, outputs, metadata, and other blockchain elements
- **Complex Data Models**: Develop more sophisticated data models with relationships between entities
- **Query Optimization**: Add indexes and optimize your database schema for your specific query patterns

### Build Applications On Your Data

- **REST APIs**: Create endpoints to expose your indexed data to client applications
- **Data Analytics**: Perform aggregations and analytics on the blockchain data
- **Visualizations**: Build dashboards and charts to visualize blockchain activity
- **Event Notifications**: Implement webhooks or notifications for specific blockchain events

### Advanced Features
