Argus is built on [Chrysalis](https://github.com/SAIB-Inc/Chrysalis), our native .NET toolkit for Cardano blockchain development. Chrysalis provides everything needed to build applications on Cardano, including high-performance CBOR serialization, direct node communication, transaction building capabilities, and smart contract integration that powers Argus' blockchain indexing features.
