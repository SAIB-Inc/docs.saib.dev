# Data Types

UPLC supports seven primitive data types that form the foundation of all on-chain computations. Understanding these types and their behavior is crucial for writing efficient smart contracts and debugging validation failures.

## The Type System Paradox

Despite being called "Untyped" Plutus Core, UPLC values are implicitly typed. The "untyped" designation means there's no compile-time type checkingâ€”types are erased from the high-level language during compilation. However, at runtime, operations still expect specific types and will fail if given incompatible values.

This design keeps on-chain execution simple and predictable while pushing type safety to the compilation phase where it doesn't cost transaction fees.

---

## Primitive Types

### Unit

The unit type represents the absence of meaningful data, similar to `void` in other languages. It has exactly one value: `()`.

```
(con unit ())
```

Unit is commonly used as the return type for validator scripts, where success is indicated by returning `()` and failure by producing an error.

### Boolean

Booleans represent truth values with exactly two possible values:

```
(con bool True)
(con bool False)
```

Boolean values are essential for conditional logic, particularly with the `ifThenElse` built-in function.

### Integer

Integers in UPLC are arbitrary-precision signed numbers. There's no overflow or underflowâ€”numbers can grow as large as memory allows.

```
(con integer 42)
(con integer -1000000000000)
(con integer 0)
```

This arbitrary precision is crucial for financial calculations where rounding errors or overflow could have serious consequences.

### Bytestring

Bytestrings represent sequences of bytes, typically used for cryptographic operations, hashes, and binary data. In the textual representation, they're written as hexadecimal with a `#` prefix:

```
(con bytestring #48656c6c6f)     -- "Hello" in ASCII
(con bytestring #)               -- Empty bytestring
(con bytestring #deadbeef)       -- Arbitrary hex data
```

Each pair of hexadecimal digits represents one byte. Bytestrings are the primary type for cryptographic operations like hashing and signature verification.

### String

Strings are UTF-8 encoded text, distinct from bytestrings:

```
(con string "Hello, World!")
(con string "")                  -- Empty string
(con string "Unicode: ðŸŽ‰")       -- Full UTF-8 support
```

While strings are more convenient for human-readable data, they're less efficient than bytestrings for most on-chain operations. Convert between strings and bytestrings using the `encodeUtf8` and `decodeUtf8` built-ins when needed.

### Pair

Pairs combine exactly two values of potentially different types. They're the building block for more complex data structures:

```
(con pair <integer, bool> (42, True))
(con pair <string, bytestring> ("key", #616263))
(con pair <pair<integer, integer>, string> ((1, 2), "label"))
```

The type annotation `<type1, type2>` is required in the textual representation to maintain parsing unambiguity. Access pair elements using the `fstPair` and `sndPair` built-in functions.

### List

Lists are homogeneous sequences where all elements share the same type:

```
(con list <integer> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
(con list <string> ["apple", "banana", "cherry"])
(con list <bool> [])              -- Empty list
(con list <pair<integer, string>> [(1, "one"), (2, "two")])
```

Lists support recursive operations through built-ins like `headList`, `tailList`, and `nullList`. They're the primary collection type for processing multiple values.

## The Data Type

Beyond the seven primitive types, UPLC includes a special `Data` type that serves as a universal container. Data can encode any UPLC value into a standard format used for:

- Datum and redeemer values in transactions
- Script context information
- Serialization between on-chain and off-chain code

The Data type has five constructors:

```
Constr Integer [Data]    -- Constructor with tag and fields
Map [(Data, Data)]       -- Associative array
List [Data]              -- Homogeneous list
I Integer                -- Integer value
B ByteString             -- Bytestring value
```

Conversion between primitive types and Data happens through built-in functions:

- `iData` / `unIData` for integers
- `bData` / `unBData` for bytestrings
- `constrData` / `unConstrData` for constructors
- `mapData` / `unMapData` for maps
- `listData` / `unListData` for lists

---

## Type Safety in Practice

While UPLC doesn't check types at compile time, type mismatches cause runtime failures. For example:

```
[ (builtin addInteger) (con string "not a number") ]  -- Runtime error!
```

This operation fails because `addInteger` expects integer arguments. The error manifests as transaction validation failure, costing the user transaction fees despite the failure.

---

## Memory and Performance Considerations

Different types have different memory and computational costs:

**Integers**: Size grows with the number's magnitude. Small integers are cheap; massive numbers require more memory and computation.

**Bytestrings**: Cost scales linearly with length. Preferred for binary data and cryptographic operations.

**Strings**: More expensive than bytestrings due to UTF-8 encoding overhead. Use bytestrings when possible.

**Lists**: Linear traversal cost. Accessing the nth element requires traversing n-1 elements first.

**Pairs**: Constant-time access to both elements. Useful for building efficient data structures.

**Data**: Additional encoding/decoding overhead. Necessary for transaction integration but avoid unnecessary conversions.

## Best Practices

When working with UPLC data types, follow these guidelines for optimal performance:

1. Use bytestrings instead of strings for data that doesn't require text processing
2. Prefer pairs over lists for fixed-size collections
3. Minimize Data conversionsâ€”only convert when interfacing with transaction data
4. Keep integers reasonably sized to control memory usage
5. Structure data to minimize traversal operations

Understanding these types and their trade-offs helps you write smart contracts that execute efficiently on-chain, saving both computation costs and transaction fees.
